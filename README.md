# PredictiveMaintenance_ML
Workshop for using Azure ML Studio Classic to prepare, train, and deploy ML models for Predictive Maintenance.

### Summary
During this hands-on workshop, you’ll have the opportunity to work through the design, development, and deployment of machine learning models that can be used to proactively determine when and if equipment may fail.

#### What you will learn
* The fundamentals of the machine learning models used in predictive maintenance scenarios (regression, binary classification, and multi-class classification)
* The lifecycle of building an Azure ML model
* How to extend Azure ML’s built-in capabilities with popular open-source libraries like R
* Integrating Azure ML models with external applications

These labs are based on a set of predictive maintenance machine learning models available in the Azure gallery - https://gallery.azure.ai/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3. 

#### Note(s)
* This workshop was originally developed in 2015; a lot has changed in the area of Machine Learning since then!  Azure ML Studio Classic is still available, though new investments are being made in Azure Machine Learning Service (which includes a visual designer - based on the ML Studio Classic).
